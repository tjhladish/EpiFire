// This example simulates an epidemic on a changing network using an SIR
// percolation simulation.  Since networks that change with time can be
// implemented in many different ways, here is a more detailed description:
//
// During each infectious period, 10% of all nodes "migrate".  A different
// 10% is randomly selected each period.  If a nodes is in the migrating 
// group, all of its edges are broken; this means the node's neighbors also
// end up with at least one broken edge.  These broken edges ("stubs") are
// then randomly reconnected.  The reconnection process will make sure that
// no self-loops or parallel edges get created (it's possible that
// additional edges will get shuffled in order to get rid of these).
